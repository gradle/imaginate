[.notes]
****
* start from the desktop app
* navigate to shared-ui
* show where it is used (android)
* and there's the web too -> webapp/Main.kt
* navigate to App / ImagePrompt / ImageGenerator
* image generation multiplatform desktop/android/web
* but it can also do plain JVM, that's how we use it in our build logic
* show usages of ImageGenerator, navigate to build logic
* this is still kotlin
