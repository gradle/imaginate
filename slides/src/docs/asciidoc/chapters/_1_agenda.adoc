* Imaginate!
** App demo
** Overview of the codebase (diagram)
** Explore with code navigation (start from the apps => reuse/sharing logic => image generation => also used in build logic)
* Build logic
** Reusing shared code (composite builds, convention plugins, build service)
** Kotlin code (Kotlin DSL, assignment operator, accessors, projects, catalogs)
** Dependency management (version catalogs + composite builds)
** Configuration cache (stable, usage, concept, constraints)
